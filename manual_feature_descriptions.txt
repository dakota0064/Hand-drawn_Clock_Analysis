Color code:
	Red = contour, contour center point
	Yellow = minimum bounding circle, minimum bounding circle center point
	
	Magenta = connected components comprising hands
	Purple = intersection of hands
	
	Green = bounding boxes for digits, digit labels



Contour Features:
	Center Point - used for other features
	Radius of minimum bounding circle - used for other features
	
	Circularity of contour (as measured by 4*pi*area / (arc length^2 ))
	Removed Points - number of removed concavities if Douglas-Peucker contour was used
	Center Deviation - distance between the center of the contour and the center of the minimum bounding circle.
	
	
Hands Features:
	Distance of hands intersection from center (almost all other hands features rely on intersect point being accurate)
	Angle between hands - self explanatory
	Point Density Ratio - ratio of the number of points comprising each hand (small/big)
	Length Ratio - ratio of the length of each hand (small/big)
	Bounding Box Ratio - ratio of the sides of the bounding box needed to cover the full hands structure
	Number of Components - the number of separate connected components determined to comprise the hands
	
	
Digit Features:
	Digit Radius Mean - the average distance of each recognized digit from the contour center
	Digit Radius Std - the standard deviation of the distances from the contour center
	Digit Angle Mean - the average separating angle between digits
	Digit Angle Std - the standard deviation of the separating angles
	Digit Area Mean - the average area of the digit bounding boxes
	Digit Area Std - the standard deviation of the areas of the bounding boxes
	Missing Digits - how many digits are missing from the expected distribution of a correct clock?
	Extra Digits - how many extra digits are present over the expected distribution?
	
Summary Statistics
	Leftover Ink - How much of the original ink is unaccounted for by any of the previous methods?
